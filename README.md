## Graduate Admissions Predictor using Linear Regression

### Introduction
This project aims to develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate the chance of admission for prospective graduate students based on various factors. The dataset provided contains several features, including GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, statement of purpose (SOP) rating, letter of recommendation (LOR) rating, CGPA, research experience, and capacity to afford (COA). These features will be used to build a linear regression model that predicts the likelihood of admission.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of five columns and several rows, each representing a different applicant's profile. The columns in the dataset are as follows:

Serial No.: A unique identifier for each applicant.
GRE Score: The applicant's GRE score, a standardized test score used to assess readiness for graduate-level studies.
TOEFL Score: The applicant's TOEFL score, which measures English language proficiency for non-native English speakers.
University Rating: The rating or reputation of the university where the applicant completed their undergraduate studies.
SOP: Statement of Purpose rating, which reflects the quality and clarity of the applicant's statement explaining their academic and career goals.
LOR: Letter of Recommendation rating, indicating the strength of the recommendation letters provided by the applicant's referees.
CGPA: Cumulative Grade Point Average of the applicant during their undergraduate studies.
Research: A binary value (0 or 1) indicating whether the applicant has research experience (1) or not (0).
COA: The applicant's financial strength or Capacity to Afford the program, represented as a percentage.

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a linear regression model that can predict the "Chance of Admit" for a given applicant based on their profile attributes, i.e., GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP rating, LOR rating, CGPA, research experience, and COA.

### Methodology
The steps involved in building the linear regression model are as follows:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset will be cleaned and processed to handle any missing values or outliers that might affect the model's performance.

Feature Selection: Relevant features will be selected based on their correlation with the target variable (Chance of Admit).

Data Split: The dataset will be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

Model Building: A linear regression model will be trained using the training data. The model will learn the relationships between the input features and the target variable.

Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance will be assessed using various evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Prediction: The final linear regression model will be used to predict the chance of admission for new applicants based on their profile data.

### Results
The model's performance will be presented through evaluation metrics, highlighting its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting the chance of admission for new applicants.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict the likelihood of admission for prospective graduate students based on their profile attributes. By utilizing the provided dataset and following the outlined methodology, we aim to create an accurate and reliable predictor that can aid both applicants and academic institutions in the graduate admissions process.
